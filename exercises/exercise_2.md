## Exercise 2 - pytest
**Goal**: become familiar with pytest  
**Purpose**: building and running tests

### Assignment
Build tests for the API calls of exercise 1.

Make sure you have seen output of the following cases:
- test passes, i.e. the assert evaluates to `True`
- test fails, i.e. the assert evaluates to `False`
- test throws error, e.g. because of a bug in the test

### Pytest
Pytest will collect tests based on the following criteria:
- search the current directory and all sub-directories
- for files named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`
- that contain functions named `test_*`

To run the tests, execute `pytest` in the directory containing your tests,
or specify the path: `pytest <path_to_dir>`.

Docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#create-your-first-test

### Asserts
You can use `assert <actual value> == <expected value>` to check actual values against expected values.
In general it's not needed to add an assert message, since Pytest does a great job
reporting on failed tests. If you do want an assert message: `assert actual == expected, "actual did not equal expected"`
or `assert actual == expected, f"value of actual: {actual} does not equal value of expected: {expected}"`

### Pytest output
Pytest is rather verbose in its output when tests fail. You can see examples of failure reports
here: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/reportingdemo.html

To print a list of all non-passed tests at the end of the output, run pytest with the `-ra` option.
